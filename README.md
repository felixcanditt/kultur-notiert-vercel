# Hiii & Welcome

## Kultur Notiert is my capstone project for neuefische Web Development Bootcamp

In this app, you can create a list with all those books you never manage to read and all those films your best friend has told you to watch 1000 times.

You will end up with your personal culture watchlist (books, movies, series, music, performing arts, exhibitions, festivals).

Once read or watched or visited, you can store these cultural experiences in your personal collection. Feel free to add a rating or notes.

Enjoy <3

## You can see and use my app here

There are two versions of my app.

### Shared version (with database)

If you add entries to this app version, they are stored in an online database and can be seen and edited by other people using the app. Click [this link](https://kultur-notiert.herokuapp.com/) to see it.

### Personalized version (with local storage)

You can have your own Kultur Notiert version that stores your entries on your device only and doesn't post them online. To do so, click [this link](https://kultur-notiert.vercel.app/).
